# ðŸ“š Bookie: the new platform where you share your personal library and borrow from other's libraries

## Learning the MVC (Model, view, controller) pattern with an MVP (minimum viable product) approach

### Using PHP to connect to a ðŸ’½ MYSQL-database

This new platform allows you to create a personal library and share it with others. Sometimes the book you like is not in the local library and it would be handy if some neighbor has it lingering around...
When you first come to the website you get a login/register page. Once you registered, you can login.
Once logged in, you get to your personal dashboard with your personal book collection and the books you're able to borrow.
After initiating a borrow service, you can connect to the user who's offering and agree on a date and how you'll do the transfer (by PM'ing via phone or e-mail).

## ðŸ’¡Concept & approach

In this team effort we first started a Trello board to get some mutual structure going, seeing the progress, reminders on structural design of webflow and database flow...
We brainstormed idea's and concluded rather quickly which idea we want to work on and pitch to our coach.
Manten wanted to focus on the front-end part while Nour and Stephanie would take on the back-end part.

## ðŸ¤¯ Difficulties

Due to some miscommunication, the feeling of personal incompetence to steer the project due to the freshness of PHP and MySQL and different approaches (one wanted to have result asap, another was focusing on getting to design architecture and flow first...) we all started to work 'next to eachother', so when we all merged the coherence was either not working for one or the other person. Setting up one structure but not being consistent with references to the database connection, different table structures, which left one with the working version and all of the work which is left to do and another with bugs to fix, no be able to help the other and have no oversight anymore.
I guess this is a lesson well learned: we all have to keep a close eye to setting up structures similarly, having clear input on syntax structuring as well so it works for everyone, before you start assuming things, it's becoming too late and there's no way back.
